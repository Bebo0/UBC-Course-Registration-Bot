# UBC-Course-Registration-Bot

A Python 2.7 program that can periodically checks the seating status of a course by webscraping and
and register/switch into the course/section automatically if a seat is found.

The email account I use to host the email notification bot has been removed from the CONFIGS.py file
for security reasons.
